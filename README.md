# What is the project about?
This project is a philosophical program that aims at sharpening the user's mind. The user learns, how to think critically and developes his own oppinion on existential problems. Some users will even be able to find new motivations and perspectives for their life choices. Why do you wake up in the morning? It may be a weird question and you may think, I want to be successfull or I have to earn money, but there is more to this question. 
Experience it yourself!
